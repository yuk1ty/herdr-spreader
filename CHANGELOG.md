# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `include:` entries, so a layout can live in the repository whose commands it
  names while the global config stays the entry point. Relative paths inside an
  included file resolve against that file's own directory; `optional: true`
  tolerates a repository that is not checked out on this machine. Include cycles,
  chains deeper than 16 files, and duplicate workspace names across files are
  reported rather than built.
